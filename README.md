## Installation

### From the Chrome Web Store

[Download CQ Helper from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cq-helper/naemekoogddiemkfhjjhaidalehodjcp)

### Using Git & Grunt

I recommend you have Grunt installed to automate building this extension. If you're not familiar with Grunt, [you can learn more here](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

**Clone the repository:**

```command-line
git clone git://github.com/goodguyry/CQ-Helper.git
```

**Install the necessary Grunt packages:**

```command-line
npm install --save-dev
```

**Build the extension:**

```command-line
grunt deploy
```

Now you're ready to [manually install](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging.html) CQ Helper. Be sure to choose the ```/build``` directory when asked to specify the _"Extension root directory"_.

## Import Environment Settings

If you'd like to deploy for team use, I would recommend creating a JSON file &ndash; to hold values for the settings page's form fields &ndash; to be imported by team members. This is especially helpful if your organization has more than one instance of CQ.

Of course, importing your settings is helpful even if you only have one instance of CQ.

**Note:** The imported settings will replace all current settings.

```javascript
// from environments.json
{
  "Production" : {
    "live_url" : "www.production.com",
    "cms_url" : "cq.production.com",
    "content_path" : "/content/production/en",
    "dam_path" : "/content/dam/production",
    "search_path" : "/search.html?q=",
    "external_url" : "jira.production.com"
  },
  "QA Server" : {
    "live_url" : "www.example.com",
    "cms_url" : "cq.example.com",
    "content_path" : "/content/example/en",
    "dam_path" : "/content/dam/example",
    "search_path" : "/search.html?q=",
    "external_url" : "jira.example.com"
  }
}
```

Each site can be named anything you'd like (e.g, "Production"), however, environment property names must be respected and the file must be [valid JSON](http://jsonlint.com).
